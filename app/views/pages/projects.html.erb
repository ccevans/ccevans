		<p>it's a spaceship is platform to launch different ideas and concepts.  It is a incubator and accelerator of tech businesses, cool ideas and cultural projects. The first goal is to launch a new concept on an average of 30 days until we find something worth investing resources into. Each idea will be either turn into a lifestyle business, passive income, killed off, given to a team to manage or hopefully into a high growth startup.  Our overall goal is to create a platform right here in Charlotte to launch creative, tech and cultural concepts.</p>

		<p>With that being said, we are looking for individuals who are want to learn how to build apps, websites and businesses and can bring something to the table. This will be a great opportunity to be a part of something with potential to grow.  I'm looking to build a diverse team of different backgrounds and perspectives.  Also looking for investors and partners to help with resources as the team and ideas expand.</p>

		<p>While building cool concepts for ourselves, we also provide web design services for others. <%= link_to "Checkout our portfolio", pages_webdesign_path %> and learn how we can build something unique for your brand. We are also partners with an interactive agency, <%= link_to "330 Monday", "http://www.330monday.com" %>, where we can help with marketing and engaging with your target market.</p>

		<p>My team and I love doing cultural projects and expanding the community.  We provide more details on the cool projects we got coming up soon.  Make sure to sign up if you are interested in seeing what we come up with and helping out the process with feedback.</p>
